If the JSON is valid, the "Generate" button will become clickable. Click "Generate" once to convert your JSON data to CSV or Excel format. You can add another block by clicking "Add Block" and entering new JSON data, then repeat the confirmation step. The JSON entries will be matched by key when converted. If a key and value exist only in one of the JSON files, they will be included in the output, but the corresponding places in the other JSON entries will be empty. Ensure each JSON entry is correctly formatted, and the keys must match across different entries for proper conversion to CSV or Excel format.""";
